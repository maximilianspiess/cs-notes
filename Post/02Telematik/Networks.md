# Network models

## Layers

Why do we use them? To simplify things. Complicated relations can be made easy via a model.

## Protocols

Standardisation of processes to simplify communication (not only spoken).

Functions:

- Connection classes
- Data directing
- Sizing (packages)
- Error solving
- Transaction overview


## OSI Model

Physical - Data Link - Network - Transport - Session - Presentation - Application

1. Physical: Physical Data Transport
2. Data Link: Did packages arrive?
3. Network: Data routing
4. TRansport: Divide data into packages
5. Session: session management
6. Presentation: pre-processing to show
7. Application: connection to user

## TCP/IP Model

Layer 7 to 5: Application layer
Layer 4: Transport
Layer 3: Data routing
Layer 2 and 1: Network access
