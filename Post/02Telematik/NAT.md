# NAT - Network Address Translation

NAT is required to allow many hosts in a network to access the internet using one single public IP. This means that, whenever a host sends data outside of the network, the IP has to be translated at the point it passes the router, and the same for data coming in. The ports are also changed to match the correct ones on the host.
