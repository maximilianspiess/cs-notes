# Data security

## Value

Data is valuable. Why? Because it allows you to model and analyze your target. Information is power.

## Data protection

The protection of someone's data against unlawful use. It is a part of the entire data processing process, like the storage, processing and archiving, up to deleting. Throughout all of this, the law has to be followed.

## Cons of big data

Protection:

- who processes the data?
- what can be read from then?

Safety:

- Who can access the data?
- What, when it is misused?

Data has to be analyzed with algorithms. Algorithms are written by humans and humans are faulty. It's impossible for them to think about all possibilities and consider all outcomes. This leads to data abuse.

## Data to protect

- Medical information
- political affiliation
- religion
- biometrics
- finances
- government bureaus

## Medical record analysis
