# Big Data

## What is it?

Anything where big amounts of data (duh) come into play: internet, online shopping, GPS tracking, etc.
Data sources: Police, Banks, Social media, communication, fitness tracker, apps, smart cars, smart homes, government offices. Pretty much in most places, data is generated and stored somewhere!

(Layers for other file:

- sensing: I2C, NFC, UART, GPIO
- network: Ethernet, WiFi, 3G/4G, LoraWan, ZigBee, ZWave
- middleware: MQTT, SQL,
- application: HTTP/S)

## Dimensions - The 6 Vs

Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, Validity, Value

### Volume

We have to store all of it somewhere. But where? And how much bandwidth do we need to transport this? Depending on that, we might choose a different protocol. Oh, and the more data points we have, the better our analysis can be.

### Velocity

When does data have to be where? A lot of times, data has to be processed in real time, like with weather and others environmental events. A decision has to be made about what data has to be processed when.

### Variety

Where does our data come from? Is it structured, unstructured, semi-structures? And who created this data: people or machines? All of this has to be considered in order to know what we do with this data.

### Veracity

Is our data even good data? Because there's no use in having lots and lots of bad data. We have to make sure our sensors are working as intender and our data is being transported safely, with encryption, for example.

### Validity

### Value

## Pros of big data

We can identify patterns and make the processes in those patterns more efficient. Business processes can be optimized, machines can be made more efficient, etc.
